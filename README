*This branch aims to upgrade to gnuradio 3.8.2*

Single user Functionalities:

	Sending and receiving LoRa packets between USRP-USRP and USRP-commercial LoRa transceiver (tested for Adafruit Feather 32u4 RFM95).

	Spreading factors: 7-12 (without reduce rate mode)
	Coding rates: 0-4
	Implicit and explicit header mode
	Payload length: 1-255 (payload length<sf might cause issue in certain situations)

	Verification of payload CRC
	Verification of explicit header checksum

-An example of a transmitter and a receiver can be found in gr-lora_sdr/app/single_user (both python and grc).

-Installation:
	-Download the zip archive and extract it
	-Similarly to any GNU Radio OOT module, it can be build with:
		cd [path to gr-lora_sdr]
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..  (-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX={your prefix} can be used to select a specific installation prefix)
		make
		(sudo) make install
		sudo ldconfig (if installing as root user)


-Frequent errors:
	The OOT blocks doesn't appear in gnuradio-companion:	
		-The new blocks can be loaded in gnuradio-companion by adding the following lines in home/.gnuradio/config.conf (If this file doesn't exist you need to create it):
			[grc]
			local_blocks_path=path_to_the_downloaded_folder/gr-lora_sdr/grc

  	"ImportError: No module named lora_sdr":
		- This issue comes probably from missing PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH                             
		- Refer to https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/ModuleNotFoundError to modify those variables. If you set a prefix during the "cmake" call, skip directly to point C.(Verifying that the paths exist in your folders might help.)


-Requirements:
	Gnuradio 3.8.2
	python 3
	cmake
	swig
	libvolk
	Boost
	UHD
	gccs
	gxx
